# San Francisco Crime Data Analysis
The first of two projects from my data analytics apprenticeship at COOP.

Collaberated in a group of 4 to find patterns and analyze crime in San Francisco from 2018 to 2023.
Analyzed the frequency of crime based on neighborhood, category, hour of the day, and holidays.
